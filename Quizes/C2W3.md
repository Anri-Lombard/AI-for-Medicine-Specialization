# Survival

1. Let f(x) be the probability that a person with feature x dies within 5 years. Let S_x(t) be the survival function of a person with feature x.  Assume t is measured in years. Which of the following is true? 
   - f(x) = 1-S_x(5) 

2. The survival function is always:
   - Decreasing

3. Which of the following is a difference between survival data and classification datasets?  
   - In survival data the labels are amounts of time and in classification data the labels are binary

4. Which of the following is an example of censoring?  
   - Patient does not have the event by the end of the study period.
   - Death due to other, unrelated causes (such as an automobile accident) 
   - The patient withdraws from a study before having an event, and before the study ends.

5. Estimate P(T>2âˆ£T>=2) from the following dataset:
   - 1/2 x 3/4

6. Compute the probability of surviving up to 4 years S(4) given the following dataset using the Kaplan Meier estimate:
   - 3/4 x 1/2

7. Compute S(5) given the following dataset using the Kaplan Meier estimate (note, it's the same dataset as in the previous question).
   - 1/4 x 0

8. True or False: If t is larger than the longest survival time recorded in the dataset, then S(t)=0 according to the Kaplan-Meier estimate.  
   - False
