    "Our heuristic for detecting negation is still relatively simple and you can think of some examples that would fool it. To improve performance even further, you'll leverage a more sophisticated approach using a [dependency parser](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/nndep.html). \n",

    "A dependency parser extracts the underlying structure of the text, vizualized in the tree diagram above. \n",
    "- Using a dependency parser, you can detect the relationship between different words in the sentence and understand which word is affected by negative phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations of dependency parsers are very complex, but luckily there are some great off-the-shelf tools to do this. \n",
    "- One example is [NegBio](https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/NegBio), a package specifically designed for finding negative and uncertain mentions in X-ray radiology reports. \n",
    "- In addition to detecting negations, `negbio` can be configured to use a dependency parser that has been specifically trained for biomedical text. \n",
    "- This increases our performance given that biomedical text is full of acronyms, nomenclature and medical jargon.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've configured `negbio` to:\n",
    "1. Parse sentences using the Bllip parser trained using [David McClosky’s biomedical model](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~mcclosky/biomedical.html)\n",
    "2. Compute the universal dependency graph of each sentence using Stanford [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/)\n",
    "3. Use a collection of dependency graph rules to detect the negative or positive presence of a phrase based on configurable patterns. It also comes packaged with the negation and uncertainty rules from the CheXpert project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch with this more involved method is that it takes a while (~1.5h on a fast laptop) to run the detection pipeline on the 1000-sample dataset. \n",
    "- Hence, you can do your comparison on a smaller subset of the data (200 samples). \n",
