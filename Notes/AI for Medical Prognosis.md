## Week 1: Linear Prognostic Models

__What is the Risk of Getting a Disease?__

- _Medical prognosis_ refers to the prediction of the likely course and outcome of a medical condition based on the patient's current condition and medical history.

__Prognostic Models in Medical Practice__

- AI prognosis in medicine is the process of using machine learning algorithms and techniques to create models that predict the likelihood of a patient's future medical outcome, based on the patient's current condition, medical history and other relevant data, typically these models output a risk score which can be a number or a probability that indicates the level of risk for a specific outcome.
