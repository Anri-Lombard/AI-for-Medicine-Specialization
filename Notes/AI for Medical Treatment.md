## Week 1: Treatment Effect Estimation

__Randomized Control Trials__

- In a randomized control trial (RCT), a _control group_ or a _placebo group_ is used as a comparison to the experimental group in order to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment. The control group typically receives either no intervention or a standard treatment while the experimental group receives the intervention or treatment being studied. The use of a control group allows researchers to determine whether any observed changes in the experimental group are due to the intervention or treatment being tested or due to other factors such as chance or the natural progression of the disease. The use of a placebo group is also common in clinical trials of drugs where the placebo group receives a treatment that looks similar to the experimental treatment but has no active ingredient, this helps to control for the placebo effect and allows researchers to determine whether any observed changes in the experimental group are due to the drug or due to other factors such as chance or the natural progression of the disease.
- _Absolute risk_ refers to the probability of a specific event occurring in a population. It is often used in medical research to express the likelihood of an individual developing a certain condition or disease, or experiencing a certain outcome. Absolute risk is typically measured as a percentage or as a ratio and it is calculated by dividing the number of events (e.g. number of individuals who develop a certain condition) by the total number of individuals in the population. Absolute risk can be used to compare the risk of a certain event occurring between different groups of individuals or to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment. It's important to note that absolute risk is different from relative risk which is the ratio of the probability of an event in one group to the probability of the same event in another group. Absolute risk gives the specific probability of an event occurring in a population, while relative risk compares the risk between different groups.
- _Selection bias_ refers to the systematic differences in characteristics between the individuals who are selected for a study and those who are not, that may affect the results of the study.
