## Week 1: Treatment Effect Estimation

__Randomized Control Trials__

- In a randomized control trial (RCT), a _control group_ or a _placebo group_ is used as a comparison to the experimental group in order to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment. The control group typically receives either no intervention or a standard treatment while the experimental group receives the intervention or treatment being studied. The use of a control group allows researchers to determine whether any observed changes in the experimental group are due to the intervention or treatment being tested or due to other factors such as chance or the natural progression of the disease. The use of a placebo group is also common in clinical trials of drugs where the placebo group receives a treatment that looks similar to the experimental treatment but has no active ingredient, this helps to control for the placebo effect and allows researchers to determine whether any observed changes in the experimental group are due to the drug or due to other factors such as chance or the natural progression of the disease.
- _Absolute risk_ refers to the probability of a specific event occurring in a population. It is often used in medical research to express the likelihood of an individual developing a certain condition or disease, or experiencing a certain outcome. Absolute risk is typically measured as a percentage or as a ratio and it is calculated by dividing the number of events (e.g. number of individuals who develop a certain condition) by the total number of individuals in the population. Absolute risk can be used to compare the risk of a certain event occurring between different groups of individuals or to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment. It's important to note that absolute risk is different from relative risk which is the ratio of the probability of an event in one group to the probability of the same event in another group. Absolute risk gives the specific probability of an event occurring in a population, while relative risk compares the risk between different groups.
- _Selection bias_ refers to the systematic differences in characteristics between the individuals who are selected for a study and those who are not, that may affect the results of the study.

__Average Treatment Effect__

- The _Neyman-Rubin_ causal model, also known as the potential outcomes framework, is a statistical framework used to infer causality from observational data. It is based on the idea that for each individual, there are two potential outcomes: one that would occur if the individual were exposed to a certain treatment or intervention (the treatment outcome), and one that would occur if the individual were not exposed (the control outcome). The model posits that the difference between these two outcomes, known as the causal effect, can be used to infer causality. In order to identify the causal effect, the model relies on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, which means that any observed associations between the treatment and the outcome can be attributed to the treatment and not to other factors.
- _ATE (Average Treatment Effect)_ and _ARR (Absolute Risk Reduction)_ are two metrics used to measure the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment in a population.

    ATE is a measure of the average difference in outcomes between the individuals in the treatment group and the control group. It is calculated as the difference in the expected outcomes between the two groups, and represents the overall effect of the treatment on the population. It is often used to compare the effectiveness of different treatments.

    ARR is a measure of the absolute difference in risk between the treatment group and the control group. It is calculated as the difference in the probability of an event (such as a disease or death) occurring between the two groups and is often expressed as a percentage or a ratio. ARR is used to compare the risk of an event occurring between the treatment group and the control group, and it is useful for communicating the benefits of a treatment to patients and other stakeholders.

    While ATE is measuring the average change across the population, ARR is measuring the change in risk for an individual. Both metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment and can be used to make decisions about treatment options, but they have different implications for different groups of people.
- The _Two-tree T-learner method_ is a machine learning method used to estimate treatment effects from observational data. The method is based on the idea of building two decision trees: one for the treatment group and one for the control group. Each tree is built using a set of features that are believed to be associated with the outcome of interest. By comparing the predictions made by the two trees, the method can estimate the treatment effect for each individual. The Two-tree T-learner method is particularly useful when there are many confounding variables and when the treatment effect is heterogeneous across the population.

    The Two-tree T-learner method is often used in the context of causal inference to estimate the treatment effect of a given intervention or treatment on a specific outcome. The method uses a set of features to predict the outcome for both the treatment and control groups, and then compares the predictions to estimate the treatment effect. The method is particularly useful when there are many confounding variables and when the treatment effect is heterogeneous across the population.
- The _Single-tree S-learner method_ is a machine learning method used to estimate treatment effects from observational data. The method is based on the idea of building a single decision tree using a set of features that are believed to be associated with the outcome of interest. The decision tree is built to predict the outcome for both the treatment and control groups, and then the method compares the predictions to estimate the treatment effect for each individual. The Single-tree S-learner method is particularly useful when there are fewer confounding variables and when the treatment effect is homogeneous across the population.

    The Single-tree S-learner method is a machine learning method that uses a single decision tree to estimate treatment effects from observational data. This method is used to predict the outcome of a given intervention or treatment on a specific outcome, it uses a set of features to predict the outcome for both the treatment and control groups, and then compares the predictions to estimate the treatment effect. The Single-tree S-learner method is useful when there are fewer confounding variables and when the treatment effect is homogeneous across the population. It's also simpler to implement and understand when compared to the Two-tree T-learner method.
