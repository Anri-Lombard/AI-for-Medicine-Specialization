__Handling Class Imbalance and Small Training Sets__

- 3 key challenges:
  1. Class Imbalance
  2. Multi-task
  3. Data size
- Data imbalance means that the number of examples in one class is much larger than the number of examples in another class, and can be countered with _weighted loss_ to get equivalent probabilites for each type of example or _resampling_ to get equivalent amounts of examples of each type.
- Multi-task refers to different tasks that are related to each other, and can be countered with _multi-task learning_ to get better performance on each task.
- Dataset size refers to the small dataset size, and can be countered with _transfer learning_ to get better performance on the task.
